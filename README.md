#Introduction:
This Script underlays the hexadecimal, rgb or named CSS color codes with their real color.
The foreground color is selected appositely.

#Limitations:
It can only work by calling a command.
Due to limitation of current sublimetext api
it colorize regions by creating new syntax and theme files.
Still in alpha, so may be full of bugs.
